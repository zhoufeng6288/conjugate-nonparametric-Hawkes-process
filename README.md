# conjugate-nonparametric-Hawkes-process
The repository implements the demo code for the paper "Efficient Inference for Nonparametric Hawkes Processes Using Auxiliary Latent Variables". It includes three statistical inference methods in the paper. 

We recommend to read the tutorial to get familiar with this module. It introduces the key points in the model and illustrates how to perfrom inference.

For any further details, please refer to the paper. 

Update
=====================================================
We provide a more elegant mean-field variational inference in the module  `conjugate_np_hawkes_new` where the update of probabilistic branching matrix has a closed-form solution.
